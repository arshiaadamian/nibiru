Assignment 1 Comp 2510
Section 1
Due Sunday, October 4th, 2025, 11:59 PM in the Learning Hub Assignment drop box.
Read the entire assignment carefully, especially the sections about assignment
preparation and Plagiarism / Collaboration. The assignment is intended to help you
practice programming, not to assess your programming skills.
This is an individual assignment
There are four programming projects, worth a total of 20 marks.
Project 1: Write a program that requests the download speed in megabits per second
(Mbs) and the size of a file in megabytes (MB). The program should calculate the
download time for the file. Note that in this context one byte is eight bits. Use type float,
and use / for division. The program should report all three values (download speed, file
size, and download time) showing two digits to the right of the decimal point, as in the
following:
At 18.12 megabits per second, a file of 2.20 megabytes downloads in 0.97 seconds.
Project 2: Write a program that asks the user to enter a height in centimeters and then
displays the height in centimeters and in feet and inches. Fractional centimeters and
inches should be allowed, and the program should allow the user to continue entering
heights until a nonpositive value is entered. A sample run should look like this:
Enter a height in centimeters: 182
182.0 cm = 5 feet, 11.7 inches
Enter a height in centimeters (<=0 to quit): 168.7
168.0 cm = 5 feet, 6.4 inches
Enter a height in centimeters (<=0 to quit): 0
bye
Project 3: Write a program that requests lower and upper integer limits, calculates the sum
of all the integer squares from the square of the lower limit to the square of the upper limit,
and displays the answer. The program should then continue to prompt for limits and display
answers until the user enters an upper limit that is equal to or less than the lower limit. A
sample run should look something like this:
Enter lower and upper integer limits: 5 9
The sums of the squares from 25 to 81 is 255
Enter next set of limits: 3 25
The sums of the squares from 9 to 625 is 5520
Enter next set of limits: 5 5
Done

Project 4: Write a program that initializes an array-of-double and then copies the contents
of the array into three other arrays. (All four arrays should be declared in the main
program.) To make the first copy, use a function with array notation. To make the second
copy, use a function with pointer notation and pointer incrementing. Have the first two
functions take as arguments the name of the target array, the name of the source array, and
the number of elements to be copied. Have the third function take as arguments the name of
the target, the name of the source, and a pointer to the element following the last element of
the source. That is, the function calls would look like this, given the following declarations:
double source[5] = {1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5};
double target1[5];
double target2[5];
double target3[5];
copy_arr(target1, source, 5);
copy_ptr(target2, source, 5);
copy_ptrs(target3, source, source + 5);
Section 2
Comments and documentation Details:
Do not create comments for the sake of creating comments. Focus is on quality not on
quantity. Comments should be succinct and to the point. If you can be brief, then do so.
Please use English that is grammatically correct.

Section 3
Assignment Grading
The grade for this assignment will be assigned out of 20 points.
• up to 4 points for commenting and following the style guide, and
• up to 16 points for correctness.
Section 4
Schedule
Your project is due on the assigned date at the assigned time. Late assignments will
count as zero (exceptions without a medical note). It will be your responsibility to
ensure that you’ve submitted the appropriate files and that you’ve done so on time.
How to hand in COMP 2510 Assignments (details)
1) Use clear and consistent names: name_assignment1.c
Page 3 of 5
2) At the very top of your .c file, include a block comment with:
/*
* Course: COMP 2510
* Assignment: Assignment 1
* Name: Your Full Name
* Student ID: 12345678
* Date: 2025-09-18
* Description: (short explanation of what the program does)
*/
3) Add screenshots for running each problem.
4) Upload your file into the D2L dropbox. This must be before the due date and
time.

Section 6
Plagiarism and Collaboration on Programming Projects
The assignment you turn in must represent your own work and not the work of anyone
else (including work obtained through internet searches or AI assistance). On the other
hand, it is unreasonable to expect that you will work in a complete vacuum, without ever
speaking to a classmate. The purpose of this section is to give you guidance about the
areas in which it is appropriate to discuss assignment topics with your classmates.
Violating these guidelines may result in a charge of academic dishonesty.
Plagiarism
The term plagiarism describes an attempt to claim work as your own, which you have
copied from another person (living, dead, or AI), whether that other person knows about
it or not. In a class like this, plagiarism includes copying program code, data,
documentation, etc. Plagiarism is simply not allowed. If you submit another student's
work as your own, you will be charged with a violation of the BCIT Academic Integrity
Code.
Collaboration
Collaboration is defined as two or more students working together on a phase of a
project. Working together does not mean that one student does the work and the other
student just copies it! Collaboration is allowed under certain conditions, if you are honest
about it.
You are taking this class to learn important fundamental things about computing, and we
must give you a grade that fairly represents what we think you've learned. Therefore, we
need to know that your work is your own work, so we need to limit the collaboration
somewhat. For purposes of projects in this class, here are some guidelines as to which
phases of a project are appropriate for collaboration, and which are inappropriate. This
may change from assignment to assignment.
OK Preliminary analysis of problem
OK Developing an algorithm
OK Developing a plan for testing
NO Coding
NO Proof-reading the program before compiling
OK Interpreting errors at compilation time
OK Interpreting errors at execution time
NO Testing

Working in pairs
If the assignment explicitly allows or requires people to work in pairs, then both names
must appear on the one assignment, which is handed in for the pair. In this case, the rules
on collaboration apply to the students in that pair collaborating with anyone else.
Save Your Projects!
You are required to save a copy of all your projects until the end of the semester, after
grades have been reported. Be prepared to re-submit these to the instructor if he or she
asks you to do so.
Protect Yourself
If you suspect that another student is misusing your work (for example, one of your
printouts disappeared), report this immediately to the instructor, to protect yourself
against a charge of plagiarism if another student copies your work. If there is ever any
confusion as to who copied from who, it is institute policy to charge both with plagiarism
and punish both (or all) parties.
Read the BCIT Policy on Conduct carefully.
